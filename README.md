## Introduction

The Personalized Learning AI Model leverages sentiment analysis and facial expression recognition to gauge the emotional state of students during online or in-person courses. The model's insights can help instructors better understand student engagement and emotions, thereby improving the learning experience.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyze textual content such as student feedback or course-related discussions to identify the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Facial Expression Recognition:** Detect and classify facial expressions from video frames to identify emotional states like happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, etc.
- **Personalized Feedback:** Based on the analyzed data, the model provides feedback to instructors on student emotional states and engagement levels.
- **Real-time Analysis:** The model can process input data (text or video) in real time for dynamic sentiment tracking.

## Model Architecture

The model consists of two main components:

1. **Sentiment Analysis Model**: A Natural Language Processing (NLP) model built using [e.g., BERT or GPT-based models] to classify the sentiment of textual input.
2. **Facial Expression Recognition Model**: A deep learning model, typically CNN-based (e.g., VGGFace or ResNet), trained on facial expression datasets to recognize emotions from video frames.

Both models are integrated into a unified system that processes multiple inputs from students and provides output regarding their emotional engagement during the course.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- [Other dependencies, e.g., pandas, matplotlib]

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/personalized-learning-ai-model.git
cd personalized-learning-ai-model
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

### Sentiment Analysis

The sentiment analysis component uses [mention dataset, e.g., SST-2, IMDB reviews, or any custom dataset] for training the model. 

- The dataset contains text labeled with sentiments (positive, negative, neutral).
- You can download the dataset from [link to dataset].

### Facial Expression Recognition

The facial expression recognition component uses [mention dataset, e.g., FER-2013, AffectNet] to train the model. 

- The dataset contains images labeled with emotional states.
- You can download the dataset from [link to dataset].

## Training

1. **Preprocess the Dataset**:
   - Text data: Tokenization, vectorization (e.g., using TF-IDF or word embeddings like GloVe).
   - Image data: Resize images to a fixed size (e.g., 224x224) and normalize pixel values.

2. **Training Sentiment Analysis Model**:
   - Use a pre-trained model (e.g., BERT or a custom RNN model) to fine-tune on your sentiment analysis dataset.
   - Command to train:
   ```bash
   python train_sentiment_model.py --epochs 10 --batch_size 32
   ```

3. **Training Facial Expression Recognition Model**:
   - Fine-tune a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., ResNet) on your facial expression dataset.
   - Command to train:
   ```bash
   python train_face_expression_model.py --epochs 15 --batch_size 32
   ```

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance using standard metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix for sentiment analysis, and accuracy and precision for facial expression recognition.

```bash
python evaluate_model.py --model sentiment_analysis_model
python evaluate_model.py --model facial_expression_model
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Sentiment Analysis Model Training Issues:**
  - Check if the training data is properly preprocessed (tokenization, vectorization).
  - Ensure your model architecture is compatible with the dataset size and type.

- **Facial Expression Recognition Model Issues:**
  - Make sure the images are correctly preprocessed (resized and normalized).
  - If the model isnâ€™t learning effectively, try augmenting the dataset with transformations like rotations, flips, etc.
